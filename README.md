# LUNet

## 1. Download Google pre-trained ViT models
* [Get models in this link](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/vit_models/): R50-ViT-B_16, ViT-B_16, ViT-L_16...
```bash
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/vit_models/imagenet21k/{MODEL_NAME}.npz &&
mkdir ../model/vit_checkpoint/imagenet21k &&
mv {MODEL_NAME}.npz ../model/vit_checkpoint/imagenet21k/{MODEL_NAME}.npz
```
## 2. Deployment BERT model
Either pip install, or go to hugging Face and download the pre-training weights!(https://huggingface.co/models)
```bash
pip install bert-serving-server  
pip install bert-serving-client 
```

## 3. Prepare data
1) To facilitate data management and model training, this model dataset is in npz format, and the corresponding conversion code is as follows:
```bash
python npz.py
```
2) Refer to the Text_data.xlsx file for the format of the text data. All text can be generated by GPT-4 using the following cue words:

Please describe the Camellia oleifera pests and diseases provided. The description should include the number of leaves, pest and disease characteristics and location. Answers must be based on observations from the image.Example:There is/are [CLS] camellia oil leaf/leaves with [CLS] that is/are located on the [CLS] of the leaf.

3) Partial datasets used in this study are included in the file.The complete dataset is available from the corresponding author (edalin@163.com) upon reasonable request. To ensure compliance with privacy regulations and licensing terms, requestors must:
#### Provide institutional affiliation credentials
#### Submit a signed data use agreement specifying:
Intended research purpose and Non-redistribution commitment

## 4. Environment

Please prepare an environment with python=3.7, and then use the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" for the dependencies.

## 5. Train/Test

- Run the train script on synapse dataset. The batch size can be reduced to 12 or 6 to save memory (please also decrease the base_lr linearly), and both can reach similar performance.

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py --dataset Synapse --vit_name R50-ViT-B_16
```

- Run the test script on synapse dataset. 

```bash
python test.py --dataset Synapse --vit_name R50-ViT-B_16
```
